# This is the critical fix for your specific machine.
# It tells mpv: "Give me the best video that is NOT AV1."
# This forces YouTube to send VP9 (which your GPU supports), ensuring
# hardware acceleration works and CPU load stays low.

# Keep the player open after the video finishes (optional, but nice for logs)

# YOUTUBE QUALITY SETTINGS
# Prefer 4K, but strictly BAN AV1 (av01) because Ryzen 4000 can't handle it.
# Fallback to VP9 (vp9) which your hardware loves.
