# It effectively bans AV1 by never asking for it.

# Uses the modern Fedora audio server directly for lower latency and better mixing.

# 2. Gapless Playback
# Prevents that awkward silence between songs. Essential for albums/mixes.
gapless-audio=yes

# 3. High-Quality Resampling (The "Audiophile" Choice)

# If the audio hz doesn't match your DAC/Headphones, this uses the 
# high-quality 'soxr' library instead of the basic linear interpolation.
# Warning: Uses slightly more CPU.

# 4. Dynamic Normalization (The "Radio" Experience)

# YouTube volumes are inconsistent. This filter smooths out loud/quiet tracks 
# without crushing the dynamic range too hard.

# 5. Buffer Tuning for Quality (Anti-Stutter)

# If you have RAM to spare (you said you didn't, but for high-end we bump it slightly), 
# this ensures 100% smooth playback even if you compile code in the background.
# 2. Force the cache to dump data immediately after playing it
# 3. STRICTLY forbid going over the cache limit (even by 1 byte)
